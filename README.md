# Billow Magazine
Billow Magazine is a website built with wordpress that showcases surf and travel stories from around the globe. I used the advanced custom fields plugin to give the client complete control over the structure of the content. I also used a css framework for the first time to try something new and to see whether it made developing websites more effiecent/enjoyable.

## Things I learnt:

- How to develop a custom wordpress theme from scratch
- How to use a css framework to build consistent and responsive websites efficiently and significantly reduce the number of lines in your css. 
- How to use the advanced custom fields plugin to allow clients to create custom galleries and text blocks that can be ordered to their liking.
- How to create a javascript slideshow from scratch.
- How to create a custom cursor to add some more flair to the website.
- How to use loops with different arguments to display featured posts, most recent posts, and popular posts wherever needed.
- The importance of breaking up a wordpress site into different template parts to enhance redability and reusability.
